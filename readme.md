Welcome to the official repository of my Discord bot! I'm a solo developer who created this bot to simplify Aternos Minecraft server management right from your Discord server. As a fellow Minecraft enthusiast, I know how important it is to have a hassle-free experience when it comes to running your server.

🚀 **Features**:

**Whitelist Management**: Easily add names to the whitelist, giving your friends and players access to your server. Use `/whitelist <username>` to add your username.

**Whitelist Check**: Quickly see who's on your server's whitelist with a simple command. Use `/showwhitelist` to check if your (or your friend's) username is whitelisted.

**Server Start**: Initiate server startup with just one command, making your world accessible to all players. Use `/start` to start the server.

**Server Status**: Stay informed about your Aternos Minecraft server's real-time status, so you always know if it's available. Use `/status` to check the status of the server.

**Basic Server Info**: Get a snapshot of your server's key details, including player count and current version. Use `/ipaddress` to check and share the IP address of the server.
